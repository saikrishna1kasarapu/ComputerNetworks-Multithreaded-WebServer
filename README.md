Project Overview:

The Multi-Threaded Web Server is a Python-based application designed to efficiently handle multiple client requests simultaneously. This project showcases the implementation of advanced socket programming and multithreading techniques, enabling the server to respond to HTTP requests effectively.

Key Features:

Multithreading: 

Each client request is processed in its own thread, allowing the server to manage multiple requests concurrently without performance issues.

TCP Connections:

Utilizes TCP for reliable communication between the server and clients.

HTTP Request Handling:

The server processes standard HTTP requests, returning appropriate responses, including error messages for missing files.

Error Handling:
Implements robust error handling to gracefully manage requests for non-existent resources.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Networking: Socket programming

Concurrency: Threading

Installation and Usage:

Run the Server:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Execute the server script using the command: python server.py

Access the Server:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the port specified in your script).

Testing the Server:

You can open multiple browser tabs or use tools like curl or Postman to send concurrent requests to the server. It will handle each request in its own thread and provide responses accordingly.

Conclusion:

The Multi-Threaded Web Server demonstrates the effectiveness of multithreading and socket programming in handling concurrent client requests. This project not only enhances performance but also illustrates the practical applications of network programming in real-world scenarios, providing a robust foundation for further exploration and development in web server technologies.
